# docker

These Docker definitions can be used to deploy munge/slurm in k3s.  These are all based on Cory Lueninghoener's guide that can be found at: https://github.com/cluening/vagrant-k3s-hpccluster .

We put them here as a convenience.

To deploy slurm with layerk8s, you'll want to build these docker images and push them into the local registry for k3s consumption.  See the guide for more details.
